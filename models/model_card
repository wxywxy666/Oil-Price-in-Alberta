Model Card for Alberta Oil Price Prediction Models
Model Details
Type: Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
Version: 1.0
Date: April 2024
Developers: Xiyou Wang
Institution: UofT
Model Documentation: Available in Section 3 of the associated paper and in the GitHub repository.
Intended Use
Primary Use: To analyze the impact of gas production and well counts on oil prices in Alberta from 2005 to 2022.
Users: Economists, policy makers, researchers studying energy markets, and stakeholders in the Alberta oil industry.
Model/Data Inputs
Input Features:
Gas_Production: Total annual gas production by municipality in Alberta, measured in cubic meters.
Well_Counts: Annual count of wells, including development, exploratory, and other types in Alberta.
Target Variable:
Oil_Price: Annual average price of WCS (Western Canadian Select) oil, measured in USD per barrel.
Model/Data Outputs
Output: Predicted annual oil prices based on the regression models.
Training Data
Source: Government of Albertaâ€™s Open Data portal and Alberta Economic Dashboard.
Period: Data from 2005 to 2022.
Key Characteristics: Aggregated municipal data on gas production and well counts, merged with oil price data.
Evaluation Metrics
Metrics Used: R-squared, RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), adjusted R-squared for model accuracy.
Performance: The models show moderate predictive power with room for improvement through inclusion of additional variables or using more complex modeling approaches.
Ethical Considerations
Biases: Models may not adequately capture the influence of external economic factors, global market changes, or technological advancements.
Mitigations: Future iterations could incorporate global economic indicators or alternative energy trends to enhance model robustness.
Caveats and Recommendations
Limitations: The model assumes linearity in the relationships between inputs and the target. Multicollinearity between Gas_Production and Well_Counts could affect the interpretation and reliability of the model coefficients.
Future Work: Incorporate more diverse data sources, explore non-linear models, and apply cross-validation techniques to improve prediction accuracy and model robustness.
Model Updates
Update Policy: The model will be reviewed and updated quarterly based on the availability of new data and advancements in modeling techniques.
Change Log: Initial release in April 2024. Future updates will be logged in this section.
License
Code and Models: Available under MIT License.
Data: Used under terms from the Government of Alberta and is publicly available for research purposes.
